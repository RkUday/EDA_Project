🏡 Housing in London (1995–2020) – Exploratory Data Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the housing market in London from **1995 to 2020**. It aims to uncover trends, patterns, and influential factors in average house prices and housing sales across different boroughs of London, and to compare them with national data from England.

📊 Objectives

- Analyze the change in **average house prices** and **number of houses sold** over time.
- Identify **key factors** affecting housing trends in London.
- Compare housing trends between **London boroughs** and **England** overall.

📁 Dataset

The analysis uses multiple datasets from the **London Datastore** containing:
- Average house prices per borough
- Number of properties sold
- Population estimates
- Earnings data
- Unemployment rates
- Crime statistics

🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

🧪 Key Findings

- There has been a **consistent increase in average house prices**, particularly after 2010.
- Central boroughs like **Kensington and Chelsea** have the highest prices.
- Factors such as **earnings**, **population growth**, and **unemployment** showed strong correlations with housing trends.
- **Number of houses sold** fluctuated significantly during financial events like the **2008 recession** and **COVID-19**.

📈 Visualizations

Interactive and static visualizations were created to understand:
- Temporal housing trends by borough
- Comparison between London and England
- Correlation heatmaps of influencing factors

🔮 Future Development

- Incorporate **predictive modeling** for house prices
- Extend analysis to post-2020 trends
- Build a dashboard for real-time housing data insights
